# name-initials
A Simple JUnit Fundamentals  Application

                    # HOW TO COMPILE THE CLASSES.
                      
DOUBLE CLICK the compile.bat batch file to compile the files in it.


                   # HOW TO RUN THE TEST CLASS
 
DOUBLE CLICK the run.bat batch file to run the InitialsTestCase Class.

The last time I ran it the output was:

JUnit version 4.4
.Trump.[D,J]
Time:0.024

OK (2 tests).
